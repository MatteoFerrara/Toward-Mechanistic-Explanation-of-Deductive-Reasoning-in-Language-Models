# Toward Mechanistic Explanation of Deductive Reasoning in Language Models

This is the official implementation of the experiments conducted in **[[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09340)**.

# Overview

The repository includes all necessary files to replicate the experiments conducted using the **nanoGPT** architecture introduced in **[[2]](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT)**.

# How to run
Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MatteoFerrara/Toward-Mechanistic-Explanation-of-Deductive-Reasoning-in-Language-Models.git
 ```   

Execute the `Training.ipynb` and `Evaluation.ipynb` Jupyter notebooks.

# Requirements

The Jupyter notebook `Training.ipynb` has been tested using the following libraries:

- Python 3.10
- Matplotlib 3.9
- NumPy 1.26
- Torch 2.1

The Jupyter notebook `Evaluation.ipynb` has been tested using the following libraries:

- Python 3.11
- ipywidgets 8.1
- Matplotlib 3.10
- NumPy 2.2
- Torch 2.7
- TransformerLens 2.15

Other versions may work but are not guaranteed.
